# This system by default boots in read-only to prevent data loss in
# the event of an unexpected/unprepared shutdown. To mount the file system
# in read/write, use "sudo mount -o rw,remount /" without the quotes.
# You may also use the web-based GUI to change between read-only and read/write,
# (You may need to click each setting more than once if you have already remounted
# via command-line as the site does not automatically update depending on the
# current file system state.)
